# CJLT_delivery_robot_videos

This repository showcases video stimuli further explained in the under review CJLT paper entitled "To Smile or Not to Smile? What Policymakers Need to Know about the Interplay between Expressive Robotics and Public Perception."

The videos included show three recordings of Startship robot on-the-street behaviors, and recordings of the Dax robot in the same scenarios. Each robot is depicted passing someone, being blocked by someone, and making a delivery.
